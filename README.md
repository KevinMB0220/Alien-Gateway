> **Send crypto to `@username` on Stellar**

Alien Gateway is a **Stellar Naming Service ** — a decentralized, privacy-preserving username system for crypto payments on **Stellar**.

---

## What It Does

* Maps `@username → wallet address`
* Enables payments using human-readable names
* Works natively with Stellar payments and memos
* Prevents wrong-address transfers
* Preserves user privacy using ZK proofs

---

## Why SNS

* Wallet addresses are long and error-prone
* Users manage multiple wallets across chains
* Public name registries leak identity data

SNS treats **usernames as a core payment primitive**, not just metadata.

---

## How It Works 

1. User registers `@username`
2. Username is stored as a **ZK commitment**, not plaintext
3. Availability is proven using **Circom ZK proofs**
4. Username resolves to a wallet at payment time
5. Stellar transaction is routed with memo support

---

## Zero-Knowledge Design

* Usernames are **never stored on-chain in plaintext**
* Existence / non-existence is proven via ZK
* Registry is backed by a Sparse Merkle Tree
* Only a single Merkle root is anchored on-chain

---

## Core Components

* **SNS Registry (Soroban)**

  * Stores commitments
  * Anchors Merkle root

* **ZK Verifier**

  * Verifies Circom proofs

* **Wallet Resolver**

  * Maps username → wallet
  * Supports exchange memos

---

## Use Cases

* Wallet payments
* Exchange deposits
* DAO payouts
* Creator tipping
* Cross-border transfers

---

## Vision

**One username. One identity. Stellar-native.**

Alien Gateway aims to be the **identity and payment resolution layer** for the Stellar ecosystem.
